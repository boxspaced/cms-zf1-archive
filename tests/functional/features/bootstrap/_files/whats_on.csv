They often pre-date other types of records more commonly relied on, such as census returns, and can also contain detailed plans of a site. The exhibition itself illustrates how title deeds can be used to study the local history of an area and the individuals who lived there in this case, Bromley-by-Bow from the medieval period up to the 20th century, with topics including the two mansions (Bromley Palace and Bromley House), the development of industry and post-war reconstruction.
