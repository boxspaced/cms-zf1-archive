McDougalls began as a chemical business in Manchester in 1846, under Alexander McDougall; in the course of experiments, a new baking powder was formulated. The baking trade would not take this up, and so one of the family, Arthur McDougall, set up a mill to manufacture self- raising flour. In 1869 he and two of his brothers set up a chemical plant and flour mill in the Millwall Docks - then recently opened. In 1879 the name McDougalls self-raising flour was registered and so Millwall became the home of this useful product. In 1899 the original mill was burnt down, and the Wheatsheaf Mills were built in 1901. The building is still there today, just behind the concrete silos which were erected in 1935.",IHT/imc3,THLHLA,0.00,43,76,,016_01.jpg,0

Only a few of the first tenants lived there for long - brought up on poverty and working hard they did not live to a great age after retirement. On the lawns in front of their homes, the old men played bowls and the women played croquet.

Bloom and Voss were the first firm registered with the Board of Trade and Lloyds to use electric welding. When the war broke out, they had to return to Germany and a local firm, the British Arc Welding Company, bought the rights to the electric welding operation. This firm did well, and had to move away to larger premises, but in time Green Sioley Weir, according to Alec's recollections, starved the firm of business and then bought them out, taking over the electric welding rights for themselves. Alec worked for both companies.  Welders earned a good living in the 1930’s.  Alec had worked as a welder for both companies.",IHT/pth05,THLHLA,0.00,43,76,,010_09.jpg,0

"Greenwich 1890-1899","Island History Trust Image Collection","A ferry leaving Greenwich for the Isle of Dogs. A ferry service between Millwall and Greenwich operated for at least four hundred years, first of all from Potter's Ferry slipway, close by the present Ferry House pub. A number of Greenwich watermen had the exclusive right to operate this ferry. In 1812 a new ferry company was set up with the right to carry goods, animals and vehicles, while Greenwich watermen kept their privilege  to carry foot passengers. This monopoly was challenged many times in the 19th century, particularly by William Cubitt, who wanted to operate his own service across the river for his workmen. From the time North Greenwich Station was opened (near the Rowing Club) the railway operated the ferry services across the river and passengers could buy through tickets from Poplar to Greenwich. The number of people needing to cross at this point was increasing all the time, but they were constantly being held up by bad weather or shipping on the river. Blackwall Tunnel was opened in 1897 to handle vehicle traffic and in 1902 the foot-tunnel from Island Gardens was opened for pedestrians, thus doing away with the need for for a ferry boat of any kind. Some Islanders remember the ferry to Dartford -  for a penny or a ha' penny you could be rowed across the river from the end of Deptford Ferry Road, behind the Vulcan pub - this was in the 1900s.",IHT/t0011,THLHLA,0.00,40,76,,017_08.jpg,0
